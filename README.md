## ðŸ›  Setup & Running

Each app is static and requires no server. Just:

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jakecush1/Javascript-Webapps.git
   cd Javascript-Webapps
   ```

2. Open the app file in your browser (e.g. noteapp.html, recipeapp/index.html, etc.)

That's it â€” no backend or build steps required.
