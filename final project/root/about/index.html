    <p>The story of Ymir Boat Club began CIRCA 1980's in beautful Ymir, British Columbia.
        Some of the first voyages Ymir Boating Club ever took were on the Salmo river, where 
        would ride tin boats down the dangerous whitewater rapids.  Some might call
        this dangerous, but for Ymir Boat Club members it was a walk in the park.
    </p>

    <p>Every year Ymir Boat Club members goes on many, usually dangerous, voyages all around the world. 
        The boat club is not for the faint of heart; there has been many injuries, some of which
        have almost been fatal.  
    </p>

    <h2>The Band</h2>

    <p>Some of the boat club members were living in Ymir playing music one night when
        they decided to form a band.  YBC seemed fitting considering all the band members at 
        the time were also part of the boat club.  And thus Ymir Boat Club (band) was formed.
        Ymir Boat Club's genre is hard to name.  Unique and Original are two words to describe it.
        With blues roots, and hints of folk rock, Ymir Boat Club brings joy to all of their listeners.  
    </p>

    <p>Years passed and the band has grown and shrunk again and again.  The band is always 
        inviting new members to bring new vibrant energy to the music production.  Though YBC 
        is more of a live experience they have been experimenting with recording music in the 
        recent years.  Ymir Boat Club has now two independently produced EP's and currnetly
        has an LP in works.
